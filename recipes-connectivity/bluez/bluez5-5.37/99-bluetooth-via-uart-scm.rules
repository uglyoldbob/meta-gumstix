# udev rules for bluetooth via UART devices
#
# Some bluetooth devices communicate with the host system using a
# serial port. To be clear: not serial-over-bluetooth a la RFCOMM.
# As the bluetooth chip is not easily discoverable via a serial port
# a user typically has to manually establish a serial connection e.g.
#
#  $ hciattach /dev/ttyS1 csr
#
# before being able to use bluetooth.  Some wireless modules combine a
# bluetooth-over-uart chip with a wifi-over-sdio chip i.e. the
# presence of a specific SDIO device also indicates that a bluetooth
# device is present.
#
# Add rules that attach the appropriate bluetooth device based on the
# wifi chip as they are configured on the Gumstix Overo COMs.
# To add:
#   $ udevadm info -a -p /sys/class/net/wlan0
# To test:
#   $ udevadm test /sys/class/net/wlan0
